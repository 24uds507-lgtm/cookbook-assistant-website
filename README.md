## üìñ About The Project

In a world of endless culinary options, deciding what to cook can be overwhelming. **CookBook** aims to simplify this process by acting as a smart kitchen assistant. Users can search for recipes based on keywords or, more powerfully, find meals they can cook right now using ingredients from their own pantry.

This project leverages a third-party API to fetch a vast and diverse collection of recipes, presenting them in a clean, elegant, and user-friendly interface.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Dynamic Recipe Search:** Instantly search thousands of recipes by name or keyword.
*   **"What's in my Pantry?" Feature:** Enter ingredients you have on hand to get immediate recipe suggestions.
*   **Live API Integration:** All recipe data is fetched in real-time from the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api).
*   **Interactive Recipe Modal:** View detailed recipe information, including ingredients and step-by-step instructions, in a pop-up modal without leaving the page.
*   **Fully Responsive Design:** A seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
